TODO:
- ident/login feature / perm authorization (reset on /part /quit /join )
- add /QUERY command to change DEF_CHAN (even to a user)
- nuke the old command syntax
- remove all warnings
- user permissions
- transition to MD5 passwords
	on any authorization attempt:
	* check if the password is a DES crypt()
	* if it is, use the plain-text password and MD5crypt it, then save 
- change puts to perror when dealing with errors
- list users
- export/import database as XML (then you can use XSLT on a webpage to browse
  the database)
- user profiles
- add/remove auto kick-bans
- recognize other bots in the channel. 
    calc:
    * if something repeats the same calc that you just did then put a delay on
      calc (back-off on collision feature)
    * if a response appears in the channel identical to the calc, don't do a
      calc. (collision feature)

    +v
    * if something +v's someone after you have, then put a bigger delay on +v
      (up to a threshold of perhaps 30 seconds?)
    * if something +v's something you already planned on, then don't +v
- more effecient calcdb access
- regex calc searching
- auto-voice feature
- dice rolling
- some commands require the nick to be used "algorithm: roll 2d6"
- DCC feature to download calc database
- SQLite calc database
- SQLite user database
- channel log files (place into SQLite)
- web stats
- +v support (don't +v if there was a -v on them)
- crypto user certificates
- +o/-o bans (take-over protection)
- persistent bans. use pQueue to maintain
- -v on bold/colors with a 'calc bold' sent to the offender. make +o immune
- SILC protocol support
- permaban requests

DONE:
+ slick config file
+ run connect/startup script
+ configurable DEF_CHAN (default channel)
+ change the 3 space indentation to tab indentation
+ remove case sensitive calcs
